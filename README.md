There is only two pages. Main and grades.
To go to the grades page, you need to click
on the courses button in the upper left corner of the main page.

In footer there are links of social media of our university. 
Other links lead to nothing (href="#")

about the chips on the site. On the main page, if you click on the moon 
and on the profile name, the picture will change. By the way, they were 
drawn by us. Like the icon in the deadline section. 
The 'images' folder contains a couple more drawn favicons, 
they will be used later.
